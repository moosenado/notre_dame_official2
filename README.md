Hey everyone,

I merged the old repository with a new Internet Application Project. So now we will have all the necessary files for roles, permissions etc.

Go ahead and clone this repository in Visual Studio. Once you have it cloned and have the files pulled go ahead and make a branch for yourself. This should help clean things up as well!
